# Margin and Padding practice
For this first exercise, the goal is to edit the style.css file so that the divs look like those in the project descriptions. Only edit the CSS where instructed in the file. You should only have to change the values of the margin and padding for this exercise. You should not have to add or remove properties in the CSS, or touch the HTML.
